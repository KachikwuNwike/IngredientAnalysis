# Ingredient Analysis

This project performs cosine similarity analysis on cuisines based on their ingredient profiles. It identifies which cuisines are similar to each other and provides a summary table of similar cuisines.

## Overview

This analysis is performed using Python and various libraries such as NumPy, pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn. The project consists of the following components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset containing recipes from various cuisines is loaded and preprocessed to extract ingredient information.

2. **Cosine Similarity Analysis**: Cosine similarity is calculated between cuisines based on their ingredient profiles.

3. **Visualization**: The results of the cosine similarity analysis are visualized using heatmaps to identify clusters of similar cuisines.

4. **Summary Table**: A summary table is generated to show which cuisines are similar to each other based on a specified threshold.
